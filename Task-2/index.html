                <h2>The Father Of Nation</h2>
                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer,anti-colonial nationalist
                    and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the 
                    successful campaign for India's independence from British rule,and to 
                    later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
                    The honorific Mahātmā,first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.
                    Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights,
                    building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all,
                    achieving swaraj or self-rule.Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with 
                    hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to
                    live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake
                    long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial
                    nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi)
                    Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.
                    Gandhi Ji had a natural love for truth and duty. With his complete dedication and confidence,
                    Gandhi Ji makes India, a free country and prove the world that freedom can be achieved with nonviolence.
                    Even today his teaching are encouraged to stay away from violence and find a peaceful situation to conflicts.
                    For Mahatma Gandhi, truth and nonviolence was his entire philosophy of life. Mahatma Gandhi was a man with simple taste and values.</p>
